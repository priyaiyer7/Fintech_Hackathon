Text Analytics on Consumer Complaints about Financial Products and Services

Topic Objective and Background:

The objective of the topic is to identify major issues that customers are facing in terms of  range of consumer financial products and services
offered by financial institutions.
We aim to identify services that have the most number of issues and perform Topic Modeling on consumer complaints to get an indepth insight
on the key issues that the customers are facing.

The data for this problem has been collected from the Consumer Complaint Database. The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints on a range of consumer financial products and services, sent to companies for response. The facts alleged in these complaints are not verified but steps are taken to confirm a commercial relationship between the consumer and the company. 
They help consumers connect with financial companies to understand issues with their mortgages, fix errors on their credit reports, stop
harassment from debt collectors, and get direct responses about problems with their credit cards, checking and savings accounts, 
student loans, and more. We analyze the data to identify trends and problems in the marketplace 
to help us do a better job supervising companies, enforcing federal consumer financial laws and writing rules and regulations.
